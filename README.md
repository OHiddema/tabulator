# tabulator
use a library (tabulator)

First practice with using a libary. Starting off with an empty project.
Next step will be using this library to enhance one of my existing Github projects.

Step 1.
First attempt.
  -create a div in HTML where the Tabulator will be displayed in.
  -create data (an array of objects).
  -instantiate a Tabulator object, which defines the presentation and functionality of the table.
